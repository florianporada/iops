# IOPS - Atomic Tomb

Introduction To Optimisation and Problem Solving In Code And Making

## Description

This repository tracks the progress (since the git history broke) of a project with the topic of find a optimised place for highly atomic waste.

## Code

The current approach is to use a genetic algorithm that finds the optimal coordinates on planet earth.
Thie fitness function test the coordinates on the following aspects:

- nearest city with a minimum population of n (n = depends on the dataset used during execution)
- if the location is in the ocean or on land
- bedrock formation of the location (this data remains patchy and maybe will be swapped)

## How it works
